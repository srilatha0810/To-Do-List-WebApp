# To Do-List-Web App 
## Abstract
Recent times show that many people are becoming forgetful in accomplishing simple tasks,
whether it be getting the correct groceries or a student completing his/her homework. I have
implemented a To-Do List, which is a web application which engineers the usage of the
Python-based Django Web Framework. The main functionalities include adding reminders,
editing and removing them and finally crossing them off when complete.
I used the technologies of (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) HTML and (Cascading Style
Sheets) CSS as the front-end of my web application, while utilizing Bootstrap as the frontendâ€™s framework and connected the Django Web Framework through Python for the backend.
